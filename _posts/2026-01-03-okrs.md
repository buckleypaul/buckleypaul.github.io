# 2026 OKRs

Following onto my OKRs from... [5 years ago]({% post_url 2021-01-02-okrs %})... I thought I'd try the exercise again. First I will start with a review of last year.

## 2025 Review

2025 was a year where my thinking of it was primarily driven by outside factors. My dad died. My kids were young and... a lot of work. I was laid off. These are the big things I think of through the year, but weren't particularly actionable "I did this well/poorly" things. So how did the year go?

### What went well?

- I kept to my goal of lifting weekly (175 total gym sessions) and progressed a bit there.
- I didn't spiral when my dad passed - it was hard as hell and it still is, but I'm still living a good life.
- Maybe just correlating with getting a new job that I enjoy more, but I'm finding myself more focused and haven't been spending as much mindless time on my phone doom-scrolling. Mentally I feel pretty clear.
- I really enjoyed taking the summer off with the family. I loved the time I spend with the kids.
- I finally started work at a startup which is something I've wanted to do for a long time.
- I made some new friends and spent more time than last year trying to cultivate relationships.

### What went poorly?

- I'm still not where I want to be health wise - I'm 20-40lbs over where I feel most comfortable and my cardio is garbage.
- I'm still struggling to fit everything in. Being effective and efficient with my time is something I need to work on still.
- The "relationships" candle is still burning low in my life. While I have a couple good online chats with friends, I could improve with my in-person friendships (and extending this beyond just having our kids hang). Also, Stephanie and I could focus a bit more on US this year beyond just us being parents. Lastly, family has taken a more utilitarian bent without us focusing as much on the emotional needs of each other.
- While I'm at a startup like I wanted, I still don't have a great direction for myself.
- We're not making many memories. We're still somewhat in the "survival" state of parenting it feels like and I'm hopeful in the coming year with the girls stopping naps, talking, and just growing up more we will begin to emerge and do fun things again.
- We spend so much fucking money on groceries and I don't even understand how.

## Objectives and Key Results

Below are some high-level objectives for the year and some key results that help indicate movement towards the goals. Typically in tech parlance,

## [Objective] Continually improve health

Last year, I did well continuing my lifting streak with 175 works and lifting every week (currently at over 3 years of at least weekly lifting!). I didn't gain any more weight, but I am still heavier than my ideal weight hovering around 220lbs. My main key result for the year will be losing weight, with the mechanism of doing so being to increase activity, improve food choices through meal prep, and reducing alcohol consumption.

- [KR] Lifting 1x/week
- [KR] Run 1x/week
- [KR] 8k steps/day average
- [KR] <= 2 drinks/week
- [KR] Weight reduced 220lbs --> 200lbs

Some things here like "do meal prep" I don't particularly want to list as KR

## Establish a new career path

## Live a more memorable life

## Cultivate deep relationships

One thing I've discovered being a new parent is the ease of creating shallow friendships and the challenge of deeper ones. For me, it's easy to pick up a conversation with another parent at the park or arrange play dates where the focus is the kids, but getting deeper than that and developing rea

## Conventional "New Year's Resolutions"
- Run Bloomsday
- Run 3x 5K races
